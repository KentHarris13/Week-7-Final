Just looking at the insert there really isn't much difference until you look at the ExtraLargeArray almost taking a full second.
Starting with the tinyArray going up the append does very slowly go up taking just a bit longer. 
I do believe If i were to run these test 10 times over the average amount would show the smallest being the fastest and the biggest taking the longest.
